# Unit-11-Express-Homework-Note-Taker

## User Story

As a user I want to make and save notes to read later, I also want to be able to delete these when they are no longer needed, so that I can keep on top of my tasks and workload.

## Status

API's tested on Postman and both POST & GET API calls work. 
Working on linking text input from notes.html, "on click" event listener via JQuery

### Method

App will have two pages:
* Index
* Notes page

Use API routes to add, save and delete notes:
* GET - read notes
* POST - add notes
* DELETE - delete notes, by unique ID

Jquery will assign note text to array.

### Requirements

* Npm FS
* Npm Express
* Npm Path
* Postman (for testing API routes)
* Jquery
